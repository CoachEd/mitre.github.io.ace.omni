---

The MITRE Corporation has been involved with many different open source
projects throughout the years, many of which have been founded by MITRE itself.
This page is an incomplete list of projects that are available here on GitHub.
If you would like to add your project to the list, submit an
[issue](https://github.com/mitre/mitre.github.com/issues) or (better yet) a
[pull request](https://github.com/mitre/mitre.github.com/pulls) with the
appropriate changes.

MITRE's Technology Transfer Office maintains a list of [open source projects
developed at
MITRE](https://www.mitre.org/research/technology-transfer/open-source-software).

MITRE has also begun developling a list of open source software [generally
recognized as safe](/gras.html).
