title: Generally Recognized As Safe Open Source Software
---

The MITRE Corporation is seeking to curate a list of Open Source Software that
is in wide deployment and use, and could therefore be reasonably "Generally
Recognized As Safe" for general use. MITRE is compiling this list as a general
reference and is seeking input into what should be included in it. If you would
like to add to the list, submit an
[issue](https://github.com/mitre/mitre.github.com/issues) or (better yet) a
[pull request](https://github.com/mitre/mitre.github.com/pulls) with the
appropriate changes.
